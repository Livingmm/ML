In fact, the Bayesian framework allows you to update your beliefs iteratively in realtime as data comes in. It works as follows: you have a prior belief about something (e.g. the value of a parameter) and then you receive some data. You can update your beliefs by calculating the posterior distribution like we did above. Afterwards, we get even more data come in. So our posterior becomes the new prior. We can update the new prior with the likelihood derived from the new data and again we get a new posterior. This cycle can continue indefinitely so you’re continuously updating your beliefs.\n",
